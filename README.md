# Line Following Robot using COMPUTER VISION
  The project focuses on developing an autonomous system where a vehicle can detect and follow a path using image processing technology. With Raspberry Pi as the main processor, the system utilizes a camera to capture images from the environment. Through computer vision algorithms, such as line detection and analysis, the vehicle identifies the position of the path and adjusts its direction to stay on course. This technology has broad potential applications in areas like automation, mobile robotics, and intelligent transportation systems.
